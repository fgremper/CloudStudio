\chapter*{Abstract}

\textbf{In this day and age, most computer programs are written by a team of more than one person. Because software engineering is becoming increasingly distributed, we require smart mechanisms and systems to reduce overhead and stress introduced by a lack of awareness and the need to resolve conflicts.} \\

\textbf{This thesis introduces a new tool for users of a distributed version control system: CloudStudio is an awareness system for Git, providing information about "who is working on what" and possible conflicts through a publicly available API. This allows developers to integrate this information in new ways, e.g. directly as a plugin for common IDEs. CloudStudio can work with all Git repositories and does not require a specific project setup.} \\

\textbf{CloudStudio divides awareness information into three distinct views: branch view, file view and content view, with each view serving a different purpose and separating the information in a way that?s easily understandable for users. Many options and filters can be used in all views to enhance the view for specific needs and make sure you find what you are looking for.}
