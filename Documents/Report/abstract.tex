\chapter*{Abstract}

\textbf{In this day and age, most computer programs are written by a team of more than one person. Because software engineering is becoming increasingly distributed, we require smart mechanisms and systems to reduce overhead and stress introduced by a lack of awareness and the need to resolve complicated conflicts.} \\

\textbf{This thesis introduces a new tool for users of a distributed version control system: CloudStudio is an awareness system for Git, providing information about who is making what changes and possible conflicts through a publicly available API. This allows developers to integrate this information in new ways, e.g. directly as a plugin for common IDEs. CloudStudio can work with all Git repositories and does not require a specific project setup.} \\

\textbf{CloudStudio divides awareness information into three distinct views: branch view, file view and content view, with each view serving a different purpose and separating the information in a way that is easily understandable for users. Many options and filters can be used in all views to enhance the view for specific needs.}
